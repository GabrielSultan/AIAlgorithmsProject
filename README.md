<h2 align="left"> COST & PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION FOR CLOUD APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT </h2>


This project explores how to build a cost-efficient and stable deployment plan for a distributed Machine learning training pipeline because day by day they are becoming increasingly large and complex. 

This can take  can take weeks or even months for some machine to optimize thses models, creating a significant bottleneck in the AI development cycle. 

To accelerate this process, companies use distributed training, where the computational workload is spread across multiple machines in a cloud environment.
This approach can drastically reduce training time, but it introduces a major challenge: ***COST & RESSOURCE MANAGEMENT.***

The objective is to configure the training cluster to minimize the total hourly infrastructure cost while ensuring the training process is stable and efficient.
